# AI Traffic management project

## Yolo/Ultralytics Setup:
```
cd src

python test_detect.py
```
We should see bounding boxes on cars/buses/trucks.

If that works, YOLO is set up.

---

```
cd src

python main.py
```

## What we achieved?

YOLO vehicle detection ✅

Lane-wise counting ✅

Adaptive green timing with live panel ✅
